#  Terraform Interview Questions and Answers (Beginner Level)

This document contains beginner-friendly Terraform interview questions based only on the topics covered so far.

##  Terraform Basics

### 1. What is the significance of the `provider` block in Terraform?

**Answer:**  
The `provider` block tells Terraform which cloud platform to use, like AWS or Azure. It also contains required details like region or credentials. Without this block, Terraform doesnâ€™t know where to create resources.

---

### 2. What is the `required_version` in the `terraform` block?

**Answer:**  
The `required_version` ensures that Terraform runs only with a specific version or range of versions. This helps avoid compatibility issues across team members or CI/CD pipelines.

```hcl
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.3.0"
}
```

---

### 3. What is the significance of the Terraform state file?

**Answer:**  
The Terraform state file (`terraform.tfstate`) keeps a record of all the resources Terraform manages. It helps Terraform understand what is already created so it can plan updates without recreating everything.

---

### 4. Where does Terraform store the downloaded provider plugin?

**Answer:**  
Terraform stores downloaded providers in a hidden directory called `.terraform` inside your working directory. This helps reuse the same provider across runs.

---

### 5. How does Terraform keep track of the resources it has already created?

**Answer:**  
Terraform keeps track using the state file. This file maps resource definitions in your code to real-world infrastructure. When you run `terraform apply`, it compares the current state to the desired configuration.

---

##  Resource vs Data Handling

### 6. What is the difference between a `resource` block and a `data` block in Terraform?

**Answer:**  
- `resource` block is used to create or manage infrastructure.
- `data` block is used to read existing resources without creating anything new.

---

### 7. What is a `data` block in Terraform? When would you use it?

**Answer:**  
A `data` block is used when you want to fetch or reference existing infrastructure. For example, getting the latest Amazon Linux AMI ID instead of hardcoding it.

---

### 8. What is the difference between arguments and attributes in Terraform?

**Answer:**  
- **Arguments** are inputs you define in the Terraform code (e.g., `ami`, `instance_type`).
- **Attributes** are the outputs or computed values Terraform provides after a resource is created (e.g., `id`, `public_ip`).

---

##  Meta-Arguments and Resource Creation

### 9. What are meta-arguments in Terraform?

**Answer:**  
Meta-arguments are special keywords you can use in resource blocks to control behavior. Common meta-arguments include `count`, `for_each`, `provider`, and `depends_on`.

---

### 10. How is the `count` meta-argument used in Terraform?

**Answer:**  
The `count` meta-argument is used to create multiple instances of a resource using a single block. You can specify how many to create dynamically.

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  count         = 3
  ami           = "ami-xyz"
  instance_type = "t3.micro"
}
```

You can also use `count.index` to create unique names:

```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
  count  = 3
  bucket = "my-bucket-${count.index}"
}
```

---

### 11. How can you use one resource block to create multiple S3 buckets with unique names?

**Answer:**  
You can use `for_each` or `count` to loop over names and create multiple buckets.

**Using `for_each`:**
```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "buckets" {
  for_each = toset(["bucket-one", "bucket-two", "bucket-three"])
  bucket   = each.key
}
```

---

##  Terraform Runtime Behavior

### 12. If an EC2 instance created by Terraform is deleted manually, what happens when you run `terraform apply` again?

**Answer:**  
Terraform will detect that the EC2 instance is missing and will recreate it automatically to match the desired state in your configuration.

---

### 13. What is the `.terraform.lock.hcl` file used for?

**Answer:**  
This lock file records the exact provider versions used, ensuring consistent behavior across environments and team members.

---

### 14. What happens if you change the `instance_type` of an EC2 instance in your Terraform code?

**Answer:**  
Terraform will mark the existing instance for destruction and create a new one with the updated instance type, as some properties can't be changed in-place.

---

### 15. Can `count` and `for_each` be used together?

**Answer:**  
No. A resource block can use either `count` or `for_each`, but not both at the same time.

---

### 16. What is the use of `terraform init`?

**Answer:**  
`terraform init` initializes the working directory. It downloads the necessary provider plugins and sets up the backend if configured. It's the first command to run before planning or applying Terraform code.

---

### 17. What does `terraform plan` do?

**Answer:**  
`terraform plan` shows what actions Terraform will take to reach the desired state. It compares the current state with the configuration and shows what will be added, changed, or destroyed.

---

### 18. What is the purpose of `terraform validate`?

**Answer:**  
`terraform validate` checks whether your configuration is syntactically valid. It doesn't access remote services but verifies the structure of the files.

---

### 19. Can you explain the role of `output` in Terraform?

**Answer:**  
The `output` block is used to display useful information after Terraform execution. For example, it can show public IPs, resource IDs, or DNS names of the created resources.

```hcl
output "instance_ip" {
  value = aws_instance.web.public_ip
}
```

---

### 20. What is `terraform destroy` used for?

**Answer:**  
`terraform destroy` is used to remove all infrastructure managed by Terraform. It reads the state file and deletes all the resources defined in the configuration.
